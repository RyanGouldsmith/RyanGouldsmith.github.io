<h1>Sprint 3 Review</h1>
  <p>Today marks the end of sprint 3 and although I do not have a meeting today, I will be continuing the story points I did not achieve last sprint in this sprint.</p>

<p>Overall, I probably estimated for two sprints, which is OK. I will roll the remaining stories and tasks to the new sprint. The first few days were a mixture of: collecting results, poster, passing driving test, weekend with no internet and more posters. Once I managed to get those out the way, I made some headway with the work.</p>

<p>###What I actually did
I completed the story card: <em>“As a user I want to be able to save a note, so I can find it again”</em>. I found from the Flask documentation they recommend SQLAlchemy for the ORM and database interaction layer. A good thing about SQLAlchemy, and like all abstraction layers, if I chose to change my RDMS then it is as simple as changing a config file.  The CRC card below helped with the design and made me think what I needed the note to store for this story point (note, no meta-data is stored in this one)</p>

<p>One thing I found which will be incredibly useful is <a href="https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Migrate</a> and with the help from <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-2-postgres-sqlalchemy-and-alembic/">this tutorial</a> things started to make sense with them. I am for migration files - working with both Ruby on Rails and Propel ORM in PHP I can see their benefits, and I think they keep the SQL schemas all together and it’s easier to track changes. Sadly, Flask doesn’t come with this stuff out the box (which I am finding to be a bit frustrating). There only seems so many ways to create a database migration manager, as shown in the tutorial, so appropriate referencing and adapting for my own project was completed. This does autogenerate the migrations directory along with a load of boilerplate code (again this has  been noted in the comments that running this script generates the directories and are not my own).</p>

<p>Finding this migration feature was useful as I was able to edit the Alembic files (what flask-migrate is practically a wrapper for). Specifically, editing the upgrade and downgrade is important here. I think because it looks to try and find all the models, and I am developing using TDD, I had to create the schema before my model, so editing the upgrade/downgrade was needed. This lead to my first database table called notes, storing the image path.</p>

<p>After much consideration, I chose a RDMS database over a NoSQL, mainly because I found that majority of the data I need for MVP is structured so let’s not worry about it. I then had the decision of SQLite vs MySQL vs PostgreSQL. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems">This article</a> had a nice little comparison. I previously used SQLite with a ROR application, but would it be suitable for this? Well, development/testing maybe but not for a bigger application. With that out the window, I came down to MySQL vs PostgreSQL - now I chose PostgreSQL because it was slightly more advanced than MySQL and I’d like to have an application which uses it properly. Again, if I find that PostgreSQL maybe was the wrong decision, I can change the database - run some migrations and be in the same place (yay for abstraction).</p>

<p>Anyway, so I had a database, time now for some tests. They were fine to write, however, I was noticing I was using the production (development in my case) database, so I quickly changed that. At the moment I am only using the database for simple read and writes by a singular person, so a temporary SQLite database was chosen. Again, I am not sure if this is wise - but everything interacts fine, I may switch it for a test PostgreSQL one, but I will see.</p>

<p>With all the infrastructurey stuff set up, I was able to crack on and get the note saving to the database. I tested the model before integrating it into the upload blueprint (route) and saving the note on upload.</p>

<p>With this change I managed to be able to do my first big refactor. Replacing all string with variables etc as well as creating <code>file_exists</code> function as functionality was being duplicated. The code base seems in a sensible place for now. I have blueprints instead of all the routes in one file. I have service objects for routine model stuff but have I have kept the model specifically for the database interactions and persistence.</p>

<p>Finally, I have investigated how to do some selenium testings with a headless browser so I can do the E2E (end-to-end) testing. This took a little longer than I wanted to. A lot of the issues were that selenium for Python didn’t like working with localhost etc, and to do so needed a selenium server. I didn’t want to run an additional server for it - so I thought there must be an easier way. Eventually, I came across the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Testing/">Flask-Testing framework</a>. This has a <code>LiveServerTestCase</code> which will spin up a server of the application and test against this. I can interact Python selenium with this. These tests were put in place for me starting the task of adding the meta-data form to the view files.</p>

<h3 id="things-which-went-well">Things which went well</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Completed a user story of saving a user’s note to the database so it can be retrieved again.</li>
  <li>Got a lot of the infrastructure decisions made with the database choice etc.</li>
  <li>Finally got some E2E tests in progress.</li>
  <li>Pre-mid project demo went well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-which-didnt-go-so-well">Things which didn’t go so well</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I lost some time this week with various things, so I feel progress halted for a while.</li>
  <li>I think Flask is a great micro-framework, but that’s all it is a micro-framework. A lot of the additional work you really have to search for to make it a good robust project. Although I do find it fun to develop in, I wish things were a bit easier to find.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-which-i-intend-to-better-next-sprint">Things which I intend to better next sprint</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I’ll be doing planning shortly, so with my supervisor away this sprint I want to get the estimation spot on this sprint.</li>
  <li>Put the application up online, rather than locally. This will be ready for the mid-project demo.</li>
  <li>Train some more handwriting.</li>
  <li>Write up the segmentation script into TDD.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-to-this-sprint">What do to this sprint</h3>
<p>Continue with the good backing I have now. I will be looking to add the meta-data form and integrate this into the database.</p>

<p>I will also be looking to the Google API’s and how easily it will be able to tie into the application.</p>

<p>More training of the handwriting to really reinforce that.</p>

<p>So this sprint (minus the story points I am currently working on) marked the “I am over 50% of the way through the MVP backlog” Judging by the points remaining and the current points per sprint, by the end of Easter MVP should be complete. How hopeful I am with that depends on obstacles along the way; it could either one of two ways with the infrastructure set up: quickly or painfully slowly. Hopefully it’s the former :)</p>
