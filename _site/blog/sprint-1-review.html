<h1>Sprint 1 Review</h1>
  <p>Today marks the day of Sprint 2, leaving behind Sprint 1. The previous sprint was mainly used to train handwriting data and optimising images for the Tesseract OCR engine.</p>

<p>Below is my burndown chart from Sprint 1.</p>

<p>I completed all but 8 story points from Sprint 1, mainly due to finding an issue with Travis CI. Having spoken to my supervisor we have agreed that it’s OK as it’s not a priority, so we will continue this task over the next few sprints to see whether it will be worth it.</p>

<h3 id="things-which-went-well">Things which went well:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Got some adaptive threshold to work</li>
  <li>Training my handwriting to a reasonable success so far, needs more data.</li>
  <li>Generated lots of test data.</li>
  <li>Created my own notes.</li>
  <li>Rewrote the spike work removing blue lines into more formal code applying TDD and structured into classes and functions</li>
  <li>Learned more about Tesseract and Open CV optimisation techniques.</li>
  <li>Continued to do (bi)-daily stand-ups as there was nothing to really discuss.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-which-didnt-go-so-well">Things which didn’t go so well:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Travis deployment is still proving a bit complicated</li>
  <li>Training the data is a long process as I have to manually go through and tag an entire page of characters per training example. (my hand hurts after a lot of writing)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-which-i-will-do-better-in-this-sprint">Things which I will do better in this sprint:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Start to use CRC cards for the development</li>
  <li>Estimation of tasks probably</li>
  <li>Bringing 25 story points into the sprint</li>
  <li>Re-estimated the Travis CI story, but I am blocked on a task due to lack of knowledge.</li>
  <li>Do daily stand-ups now that I have started actual development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="agreed-work-for-this-sprint">Agreed work for this sprint:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upload an image to the web application and a user will be able to view their upload and make this ready for production</li>
  <li>Look into removing additional noise from images.</li>
  <li>Continue to reinforce my handwriting with some more training examples.</li>
</ul>
