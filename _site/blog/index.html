      <p>Sprint 8 has been completed and it has not really been like the other sprints. As I feel I am approaching the end of the project, I have been completing issues I have come across so not as many story points have been included.</p>

      <p>Today marks the end of sprint 7. I have been doing a lot more reflection this sprint, partly because I have to write about it, but also certain things came up this sprint which made me do some self reflection.</p>

      <p>Yesterday was the end of sprint 5 and today starts the sprint 6. The burndown chart shows I only completed 76% of the work this sprint, which was not good enough really.</p>
